# Donut Derper 2

This game is a work in progress. Expect bugs and general incompleteness.

### Usage
To run the game, make sure you have Java 9 or later installed and execute Donut Derper.jar.

### Planned Features
These are likely, but not guaranteed, to be implemented in the order shown.

  1. **Reordering ingredients**
  1. **Equipment enhancements** - buying, selling, space constraints
  1. **Better donuts** - custom recipes, costs, supply and demand
  1. **More employees** - accountant, food buyer, street advertiser
  1. **Better bank accounts** - transferring $$, withdrawal fees
  1. **Better customers** - comments, bulk requests
  1. **Events** - random effects like customer floods, employees quitting, etc.
  1. **Research**
  1. **Facilities** - other stores, office buildings, employee training sites, etc.

#### Other Possibilities
  
  - "Quick Assign" button to assign self to best, unassigned station
  - Ingredients and donuts expiring regularly if unused (not just a random event)
  - Each employee has their own skill set that improves with time
  - Assigning employees specific duties from a list, like collecting cash from the registers and purchasing ingredients

### Thanks
Special thanks to Jack and Michael.
